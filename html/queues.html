	<h2>Queues</h2>
<TABLE  bordercolor="" cellpadding="2">

<td>A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to
the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. An excellent example of a queue is a line of students in the food court of
the UC. New additions to a line made to the back of the queue, while removal (or serving) happens in
the front. In the queue only two operations are allowed  <b>enqueue</b> and <b>dequeue</b>. Enqueue
means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item. The picture
demonstrates the FIFO access.
<p>The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most
recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
In the standard library of classes, the data type queue is an <i>adapter</i> class, meaning that a
queue is
built on top of other data structures. The underlying structure for a queue could be an array,
a Vector, an ArrayList, a LinkedList, or any other collection. Regardless of the type of the
underlying data structure, a queue must implement the same functionality. This is achieved by
providing a unique interface.
<dir><pre>
interface QueueInterface&lsaquo;AnyType>
{
   public boolean isEmpty();

   public AnyType getFront();

   public AnyType dequeue();

   public void enqueue(AnyType e);

   public void clear();
}
</pre></dir>
<p>Each of the above basic operations must run at constant time O(1). The following picture
demonstrates the idea of implementation by composition.

<h4>Circular Queue</h4>
Given an array A of a default size (&ge; 1) with two references <i>back</i> and <i>front</i>,
originally set to -1 and 0 respectively. Each time we insert (enqueue) a new item, we increase the back
index; when we remove (dequeue) an item  - we increase the front index. Here is a
picture that illustrates the model after a few steps:

<center><img src="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/pix/array_queue_1.bmp"></center>

As you see from the picture, the queue logically moves in the array from left to right. After several
moves <i>back</i> reaches the end, leaving no space for adding new
elements
<center><img src="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/pix/array_queue_2.bmp"></center>


<p>However, there is a free space before the front index. We shall use that space for enqueueing new
items, i.e.  the next entry will be stored at index 0, then 1, until <i>front</i>. Such a model is
called a <b><font color="green">wrap around queue</font></b> or a <b><font color="green">circular queue</font></b>
<center><img src="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/pix/array_queue_3.bmp"></center>
<p>Finally, when <i>back</i> reaches <i>front</i>, the queue is full. There are two choices to handle
a full queue:a) throw an exception; b) double the array size.


<p>The circular queue implementation is done by using the modulo operator (denoted %),
which is computed by taking the remainder of division (for example, 8%5 is 3). By using the
modulo operator, we can view the queue as a circular array, where the "wrapped around" can
be simulated as "back % array_size". In addition to the back and front indexes, we maintain another index: <i>cur</i> - for counting
the number of elements in a queue. Having
this index simplifies a logic of implementation.


<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>The simplest two search techniques are known as Depth-First Search(DFS) and Breadth-First
Search (BFS). These two searches are described by looking at how the search tree
(representing all the possible paths from the start) will be traversed.

<h3>Deapth-First Search with a Stack</h3>
<p>In depth-first search
we go down a path until we get to a dead end; then we <i>backtrack</i> or back up (by popping a stack) to get an alternative path.
<ul>
<li>Create a stack
<li>Create a new choice point
<li>Push the choice point onto the stack
<li>while (not found and stack is not empty)
<ul>
   <li>Pop the stack
   <li>Find all possible choices after the last one tried
   <li>Push these choices onto the stack
</ul>
<li>Return
</ul>


<h3>Breadth-First Search with a Queue</h3>
<p>In breadth-first search we explore all the nearest possibilities by finding all possible successors and enqueue them to a queue.

<ul>
   <li>Create a queue
   <li>Create a new choice point
   <li>Enqueue the choice point onto the queue
   <li>while (not found and queue is not empty)
<ul>
   <li>Dequeue the queue
   <li>Find all possible choices after the last one tried
   <li>Enqueue these choices onto the queue
</ul>
<li>Return

<h3>Arithmetic Expression Evaluation</h3>
An important application of stacks is in parsing. For example, a compiler must parse arithmetic
expressions written using infix notation:
<dir><pre>
1 + ((2 + 3) * 4 + 5)*6
</pre></dir>
We break the problem of parsing infix expressions into two stages. First, we convert from infix
to a different representation called postfix. Then we parse the postfix expression, which is a
somewhat easier problem than directly parsing infix.


<p> <b>Converting from Infix to Postfix.</b> Typically, we deal with expressions in infix notation
<dir><pre>
2 + 5
</pre></dir>
where the operators (e.g. +, *) are written between the operands (e.q, 2 and 5). Writing the
operators after the operands gives a postfix expression

2 and 5 are called operands, and the '+' is operator. The above arithmetic expression is called
infix, since the operator is in between operands. The expression
<dir><pre>
2 5 +
</pre></dir>
Writing the operators before the operands gives a prefix expression
<dir><pre>
+2 5
</pre></dir>
Suppose you want to compute the cost of your shopping trip. To do so, you add a list of numbers
and multiply them by the local sales tax (7.25%):
<dir><pre>
70 + 150 * 1.0725
</pre></dir>
Depending on the calculator, the answer would be either 235.95 or 230.875. To avoid this
confusion we shall use a postfix notation
<dir><pre>
70  150 + 1.0725 *
</pre></dir>
Postfix has the nice property that parentheses are unnecessary.
<p>Now, we describe how to convert from infix to postfix.
<ol>
<li>Read in the tokens one at a time
<li>If a token is an integer, write it into the output
<li>If a token is an operator, push it to the stack, if the stack is empty. If the stack is not
empty, you pop entries with higher or equal priority and only then you push that token to the
stack.
<li>If a token is a left parentheses '(', push it to the stack
<li>If a token is a right parentheses ')', you pop entries until you meet '('.
<li>When you finish reading the string, you pop up all tokens which are left there.
<li>Arithmetic precedence is in increasing order: '+',  '-',  '*',  '/';
</ol>
Example. Suppose we have an infix expression:<code>2+(4+3*2+1)/3</code>.  We read the string by characters.
<dir><pre>
'2' - send to the output.
'+' - push on the stack.
'(' - push on the stack.
'4' - send to the output.
'+' - push on the stack.
'3' - send to the output.
'*' - push on the stack.
'2' - send to the output.
</pre></dir>


<p><b>Evaluating a Postfix Expression.</b> We describe how to parse and evaluate a postfix expression.
<ol>
<li>We read the tokens in one at a time.
<li>If it is an integer, push it on the stack
<li>If it is a binary operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, apply the operator, and
push the result back on the stack.
</ol>
Consider the following postfix expression
<dir><pre>
5 9 3 + 4 2 * * 7 + *
</pre></dir>
Here is a chain of operations
<dir><pre>
Stack Operations              Output
--------------------------------------
push(5);                        5
push(9);                        5 9
push(3);                        5 9 3
push(pop() + pop())             5 12
push(4);                        5 12 4
push(2);                        5 12 4 2
push(pop() * pop())             5 12 8
push(pop() * pop())             5 96
push(7)                         5 96 7
push(pop() + pop())             5 103
push(pop() * pop())             515
</pre></dir>
Note, that division is not a commutative operation, so 2/3 is not the same as 3/2.
